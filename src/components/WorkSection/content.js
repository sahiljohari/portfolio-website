      period: " August 2019 - Present",
      location: "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.",
      responsibilities:
      "<p>As a Software Engineer, I work with businesses/clients in a diverse team of talented and experienced engineers to develop and deliver high performance, secure, and scalable software products and solutions in a fast-paced agile environment. During my tenure here, I have worked on three primary projects: a user interface for enterprise search, a crowdfunding platform for community banks to release “white labeled”, and an R&D tool to manage workforce skills and certifications.</p>" +
      "<p>My responsibilities include but are not limited to <span>streamlining front-end web development effort and code reusability</span> by leveraging the strengths of front-end frameworks like <i>React</i> and <i>Angular</i>; organizing code into robust and maintainable UI components for rapid development. I further excel in developing software with engaging user experience and modern look-and-feel across multiple platforms (web, mobile), and have worked extensively with modern frontend technologies like <span>React, Redux, Typescript, SASS, and NodeJS</span>.</p>" +
      "<p>Alongside developing quality software, my focus is always on continuous improvement and optimization. Currently, I am working on a real-time graphical display of autonomous flight maneuvers performed by drone helicopters where I <span>improved the memory consumption by 50%</span> to facilitate smoother and optimized 3D rendering. Likewise, in one of my previous assignments, I achieved an <span>overall optimization of 70% in the application build time and 95% reduction in lines of code per feature test</span> by developing a wrapper API around Cypress framework to simplify writing integration and end-to-end tests.  </p>" +
      "<p>Apart from my primary duties, I actively participate in company events such as backlog grooming, brainstorming sessions, tech talks, and several other fun activities focusing on business processes and knowledge sharing.</p>",

      responsibilities:
      "<p>Beginning my career as a Software Engineer, I worked here on 4 large scale web application products and tools for our clients from the airlines industry to support and enhance their flight operations and aircraft maintenance processes. My responsibilities included <span>full-stack development of product features, application deployment, and monitoring application health</span>. I also <span>redesigned and implemented UI for 2 legacy web applications</span> to provide modern aesthetics and improved user experience.</p>" +
      "<p>As a Senior Analyst, I made significant contributions to the application products in terms of improving their quality and efficiency. Leveraging the strengths of the .NET framework, I developed an automation tool on a web platform which could generate and distribute over 125 analysis reports at once thereby <span>reducing the aircraft inspection and maintenance time by 80%</span>. In addition, I also worked on a defect tracking application which resulted in a <span>10% reduction in the application testing time</span>. I produced an award-winning web application to track the progress of over 20 projects in a business unit for which I received the <span>Best Performer of the Quarter</span> award.</p>",
