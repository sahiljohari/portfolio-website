        "<p>Right on Day One at Rivers Agile, I joined a diverse team of talented and experienced developers on a large scale project with <span><b><a href='https://www.draco.res.ibm.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>IBM Pittsburgh Lab</a></b></span>.

        "<p>My role was to build fully functional front-end modules using <i>React</i> alongwith collaborating with UX designers and back-end engineers to bring product features to life. My most significant contribution to the vision of this product was building the conversational feature (Chat Bot) using <i>Discovery API</i> to simplify the operational processes of customers by providing intuitive responses to their user queries.</p>" +
        "<p>I learned a great deal about writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code on this project. I also made major contributions toward instituting new standards of writing automated integration tests using the Cypress framework. Ocassionally, I participated in company events such as backlog grooming, brainstorming sessions, and several other fun activities focusing on business processes.</p>" +

      role: "Senior Analyst",
      period: " June 2015 - June 2017",
      location: "Bangalore, Karnataka, India",
      responsibilities:
        "<p>I landed my first job at Capgemini right after completing my undergraduate degree, where I joined as a Software Engineer in the .NET domain. After completing a 3 months training program in .NET framework, I joined a small team of 8 developers and worked with <span><b><a href='https://www.jetstar.com/us/en/about-us' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Jetstar Airways Pty Ltd.</a></b></span></p>" +
        "<p>Initially, my role was to perform software requirement analysis and develop front end UI of a web application that was intended to provide project management capability internally. I gradually began writing end-to-end code using ASP.NET, C#, and Oracle PL-SQL in collaboration with other senior developers in my team. A major portion of my time with the team was spent in developing an automation tool on web platform which was capable of generating MS Excel and PDF reports using production data alongwith embedding data visualization. Through iterative enhancements, I achieved significant performance gain in the application which resulted in a <b>reduction of lead time by 80%</b> for Jetstar's critical internal procedures.</p>" +
        "<p>I also enjoyed working on several other assignments involving code refactoring and revamping user interfaces of other legacy applications that our client had been using for more than 5 years. Using jQuery and Bootstrap, I improved the aesthetics and user experience of these applications significantly, making them responsive and exciting to interact with. I gained immense exposure to the software industry in this job and learned some of the vital skills that a software professional must possess, which gave me a solid foundation as a software engineer.</p>",
