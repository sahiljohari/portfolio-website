    "<p>Hello! I'm Sahil and I am a software engineer. I have been developing highly available, scalable, and real time websites and applications with pixel-perfect user interfaces for about <strong>4 years</strong>. My experience lies in full-stack development with primary focus on the front end. For the past 2 years, I have been developing web apps with engaging user experience and modern look-and-feel across multiple platforms (web/mobile) along with managing their infrastructural components and cloud-based services.</p>",
  extendedAboutText:
    "<p>Shortly after graduating from <a href='https://www.smu.edu/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Southern Methodist University</a> with a Masters degree in Computer Science, I joined the engineering team at <a href='https://www.riversagile.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Rivers Agile</a> in 2019, where I worked as a software consultant on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects with multiple clients. After spending 2 years, I switched gears and joined <a href='https://www.highmarkhealth.org/hmk/index.shtml' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Highmark Health</a> as a full-stack software engineer in 2021.</p>" +
    "<p>Outside of work, I like to spend my time working on side-projects and playing video games. I also enjoy solving coding problems that involve great analytical thinking and challenge me intellectually at every step. " +
    "I am an explorer, and tend to constantly look for new things to learn and build.</p>",
