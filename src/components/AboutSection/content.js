    "<p>Hello! I'm Sahil and I am a software engineer. I have been developing highly available, scalable, and real time websites and applications with pixel-perfect user interfaces for about <strong>4 years</strong>. My experience lies in full-stack development with primary focus on the front end. For the past 2 years, I have been developing web apps with engaging user experience and modern look-and-feel across multiple platforms (web/mobile) along with managing their infrastructural components and cloud-based services.</p>",
